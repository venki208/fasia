                <p>The journey of Indians into America was not an easy one,culturally as well as professionally. They've had to go through challenging times for more than 75 years to attain the current status. Like any other ethnic group, Indians also faced challenging times to get their first set of recognition as a community.</p>
                <p>The first major influx of the Indians from Asia into the United States was between 1904 and 1911, when more than 6,000 Indians went to work as farmhands. Although, historical documents reveal Indians visiting for trade in 1635 & 1790 AD</p>
                <p>Indians from Asia in the U.S. were first classified in court decisions of 1910 and 1913 as Caucasians, and therefore could become citizens as well as intermarry with U.S.- born whites. However, the decisions were reversed by the Supreme Court in 1923, when Indians from Asia were legally classified as non-white and therefore ineligible for citizenship. That court decision prevented Indian immigrants from naturalizing. New immigrants from India had already been prohibited by a 1917 law.</p>
                <p>The restrictions were lifted after the passage of comprehensive immigration legislation in 1965. This one change in law opened doors for the large influx of highly educated professionals from India to the U.S. for skilled employment.<a href="#block-id" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="block-id">

                        <p>In 2017, an estimated 4.1 million Indian Americans are living in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Indians are the third-largest group among Asian Americans and represent about 19% of the U.S. adult Asian population.</p>
                        <p>Studies conducted by the pew social studies revealed that Indian Americans are a highly culturally driven society than any
                        other ethnic group in the US and are also the ones with a high household median income group.</p>
                        <p>Indian Americans stand out from most of the other U.S. Asian groups in the personal importance they place on parenting; 78% of Indian Americans saybeing a good parent is one of the most important things to them personally.</p>

More than half of Indian-American adults are U.S. citizens (56%), lower than the share among overall adult Asian
                        population (70%) as well as the national share (91%).</p>
                        <p> Educational attainment, among Indian Americans aged 25 and older,seven-in-ten (70%) have obtained at least a bachelor’s degree; this is higher than the Asian- American share (49%) and much higher than the national share (28%).</p>  
                        <p>Indo Americans have created a huge impact in the last 25 years in Technology , Healthcare, Hospitality and Entrepreneurship by touching day to day lives .

As per the AAHOA, Indian Americans in the hotel and motel industry faced discrimination, both from the insurance industry and from competitors placing "American owned" signs from them. This led to the formation of AAHOA - Asian American Hotel Owners Association in 1994 as a single national association. AAHOA made the Indian American community in the last 23 years to own more than 60% of the hotel industry(lodging) and contribute for the employment to economy . A single Indian community from Gujarat, Patels contribute to more than 60% of the motel industry valued to be 128 billion USD assets under their management.</p>

                <p>With more than 300+ cultural organizations and 75+ various association spread across the United States the Indo American community stands as the most culturally diversified , most demanded, highly skilled community and second largest migrant population. Given their establishment, education , employment and earning,the Indo American community is one of the most focused community by all the wealth management industry with more than 23,000+ Indian origin financial / wealth / insurance advisors  originating from the same community. Indian American origin realtors are also one of the largest communities serving the realtors fraternity. In equal to the physician and the legal fraternity the financial advisory is one of the most sought after fraternity by every household to protect and create wealth. Financial security provides psychological security to individuals and families. In the ecosystem of 1.3 million+ advisors in the United States, Indian American advisory community is only a minority ethnic community with less than 1% of the whole community. As per the CPA institute, out of 635,000 practicing CPA in the country only a 4% of the total practitioner is of the Asian origin and out of that only a minority is of the Indian origin. In this family values and culturally driven community only 3-5% of the advisors are women advisors, which is very less than the existing market advisory ecosystem when compared to other ethnic groups.

                        <p>FASIA - Financial Advisor Society for Indo American Advisors is a society for Indo American advisors, by advisors, Committed
                        to protect and grow their lifetime assets of earnings, education, employment, equality and their social establishments standing
                        as a guard to help everyone in wealth creation and protection.</p>   
                        <p>A non-profitable organization, building the largest association
                        of all licensed Indo American professional advisors covering financial advisors, insurance advisors, real estate advisors, wealth advisors and tax advisors. We are committed to be the voice and torch bearers of all the practicing Indo American advisory community and similar interest communities across the United States.</p>  
                        <p>We believe in collaborating and protecting the collective
                        success by initiating measures that bring respect to the advisory community. With open arms we will be building bridges with
                        all Indo American cultural organizations in creating financial security in everyone's life by bringing in the best practices.</p>
                        <p>We will be known and stand for the cause from reaching out to the regulators, government representatives,  advocating and

                        we will also focus on the cross border relationships, promoting growth opportunities both locally and globally.</p>  
                        <p>The biggest question is, ‘why have an Association like this now?’ Most of the associations were born out of a single incident that has triggered the need for the cause to come together and support. In the financial service industry, the last 3 years is one
                        of the most crucial times. This decade has disrupted the whole of the financial system and whatever that has happened in
                        the last century. Virtual currencies growth , digital transactions , robo advisory , fintech adaptation , smart phones and
                        smart instruments penetration ,new millennial billionaires all leading to the consumer behavioral change towards the advisory
                        ecosystem , artificial intelligence , cognitive analytics , machine learning , deep learning and blockchain and deep technologies foraying into the financial servicing space ,on the other side, accessibility to global products , innovative product structures , smart contacts , smart products and social finance of social savings , investments , social trading are taking over this
                        domain slowly and steadily. This presses the need for coming together, sharing, co- learning, and growing together. We believe
                        that this is the time to embrace change and establish the presence of advisors in the ecosystem. It’s the time to build a
                        purpose led community.</p> 
                        <p>Advisory is a cultural phenomenon than just consumer behavior . Looking for advisory and seeking for advisory exists from the time the documentation of humanity has been established. It’s the general tendency of humans to seek advice while making important decisions in life, irrespective of the cultural background. Especially when it comes to health and wealth the dependency of advisory leads the path. Advisory is not just about rational decision making, it’s a mixture of rational and emotional intelligence.</p>
